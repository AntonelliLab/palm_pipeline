    "SeCaPr is available as a conda package on the bioconda channel. This makes installation very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the **Python2.7 version** of [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and install it by executing the downloaded sh-file (see commands below). Conda is a software and environment manager, that makes installation of new software and of required dependencies very simple and straightforward.\n",

    "**Download conda:**\n",

    "### 2. Install the SECAPR environment\n",
    "Conda automatically downloads and installs all necessary software dependencies. We strongly recommend to **install SECAPR and all it's dependencies in a separate virtual environment**, in order to not interfer with potentially already installed verisons of the software dependencies.\n",

    "When the environment is activated, all the necessary software dependencies will be available in the standarad path, e.g. when you type `samtools` the samtools version required for SECAPR will be executed. After you are done using secapr, you can deactivate the environment to switch back to your standard environment with this command:\n",

    "Check if you are connected to the correct environment (there should eb a star in front of secapr_env in the output of this command):\n",
