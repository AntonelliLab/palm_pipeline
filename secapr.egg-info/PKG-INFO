        This semi-automated pipeline aims to make the processing and analysis of sequence capture (= target enrichment) data simple and straight forward for all users. The detailed documentation and simple installation makes this pipeline accessible also for users with limited biofinformatic knowledge, while enabling user-defined processing options for the more experienced users.
        
        We included an empirical data tutorial in the [pipeline documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AntonelliLab/seqcap_processor/blob/master/docs/documentation/main_doc.html), which covers the processing from raw Illumina read data into multiple seqeunce alignments (MSAs) for phylogenetic analyses, including the compiling of allele sequence MSAs. This workflow can be applied to any Illumina dataset, independently of the underlying bait set and organism group.
        
        Some functions in this pipeline are inspired by the scripts from the [Phyluce pipeline](https://github.com/faircloth-lab/phyluce) by Braint Faircloth, which is aimed at the processing of Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs). To honour some of the ingenious ideas belonging to Brant Faircloth, and the generous sharing of all his code as open-source, we ask you to cite the Phyluce pipeline (Faircloth 2016) alongside with ours (Andermann et al. 2018), when using SECAPR.  
        
        
        ## Workflow

        **SECAPR analytical workflow.** The flowchart shows the basic SECAPR functions, which are separated into two separate steps (colored boxes). Blue box (1. reference library from raw data): in this step the raw reads are cleaned and assembled into contigs (de novo assembly); Orange box (2. reference based assembly with custom reference library): the contigs from the previous step are used for reference-based assembly, enabling allele phasing and additional quality control options, e.g. concerning read-coverage. Black boxes show SECAPR commands and white boxes represent the input and output data of the respective function. Boxes marked in grey represent multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) generated with SECAPR, which can be used for phylogenetic inference.
